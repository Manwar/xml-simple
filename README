DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple - Easy API to read/write XML (esp config files)


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires a module capable of parsing XML - either XML::SAX or
  XML::Parser must be installed (if you're running ActivePerl, you'll
  already have XML::Parser installed).

  To generate documents with namespaces, XML::NamespaceSupport is required.

  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).

  If you want to test the module, but don't have 'make', try:

      perl maketest
